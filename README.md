# Simple Component Library

This is a simple react components library. To see the components, run `npm run storybook` and view the documentation at [localhost:6006](localhost:6006). To change the theme, modify the `src/scss/_vars.scss` file and recompile `src/css/index.scss` to `src/index.css`.

I plan to expand or improve this library based on personal needs in my future projects.
